## 🧾 Dataset

We use the **20 Newsgroups Dataset**, a collection of ~18,000 newsgroup posts across 20 categories.
📂 Dataset Source: 20 Newsgroups

The dataset used in this project is the 20 Newsgroups dataset, which contains approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents across 20 categories.

## 🧠 Topic Modeling Techniques Used

This project implements and compares the following techniques:

- **LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)**: A generative model where each document is a mixture of topics.
- **NMF (Non-negative Matrix Factorization)**: Matrix factorization that uncovers latent topics based on non-negativity.
- **KMeans Clustering**: Distance-based document clustering followed by keyword-based topic extraction.
